README			how to connect paraview to multliple servers and test load-balancing
			this file is the explanatory/tutorial file for the paraview_and_pvserver_jureca.sh

open paraview		with the script stammsen_run_paraview_and_pvserver.job
start servers		in the same script :)
connect to servers	server symbol green
	first time	add the connection (first one is 11111), name it ...
	after that	choose the installed configuration from the list:
				- the main server is addressed
				- that server communicates to the others
				- the server script sets up a configuration !! which is saved
				- different server configuration => add new server :)
create data		wavelet source
properties		"Whole Extent" to 100 or 1000
memory usage		check Memory Inspector (client and servers/processes are shown)
contour filter		creates full inner structure for the wavelet
ProcessIdScalars	shows which process clculates which part of the pipeline
			alternative: vtkProcessId
			automatic polling makes it look like 100% ?!?!
			pipeline automatically distributed between the nodes?/processes?/servers?
