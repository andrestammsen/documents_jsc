BENCH_SCRIPTS_JHG	SUMMARY OF THE GitLab REPOSITORY TO PRODIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A BENCHMARKING PROCEDURE

1) create new template	general copy for completely new entire benchmark run
				a) copy example directory template.lsf
				b) change MPI parameters
				c) change grep_timings
				d) change plot_bench

2) modify/run		modify basic script and create all necessary job scripts
				a) adjust runtine, memory... in create_bench
create bench			b) run create_bench

3) run benchmarks	run tests
				a) run_bench

4) plot results		plot tests
				a) run plot_bench
				b) dump as text file and image file



create bench		general directory
				manual settings for mpi
				automatic settings based on the manual ones by calculation
				grab bench directory
				create benchmark-subdirectory
				dump mpi settings in bench_settings file

				create subdirectories for each test
				replace mpi task number
				replace number of nodes
				replace mpi memory
				replace parallel env
				replace testtime
				replace mpi per node

run bench		check directory
			go to directory
			execute all tests

plot bench		grab directory
			go to directory
			read bench settings
			check amount of timing parameters
			count number of tests
			get timings and evaluate per test
			plot timings

bench example		contains result of one benchmark run
				test file for each scenario (number of nodes etc)
					job script for the cluster (or several ones)
					settings file specific for scenario (replaces entries in job script)
				settings file general (mpi per node, min/max mpi tasks ...)
				timing file to extract timing data (comm-time, x, y, z)
				plot file, concrete version for plotting
