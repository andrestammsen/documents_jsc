new usage model		

one account per person	stammsen2
			user is uniquely assigned to one account	
			primary group id : jusers
			secondary groups manage CPU quota
			HOME-directory: /home/jusers/stammsen2/jureca
				=> new home structure includes the system the user is currently working at
				=> different config files for different systems possible
			SHARED-directory: /home/jusers/stammsen2/shared for common data
			e.g.	primary general group	stammsen2
				secondary group		cjsc for access to the project

project space separated	$HOME can be considered as private to the user
from user space			=> should only be used for ssh-keys, config files etc
			$PROJECT for every project for data, executables, libraries ...
				=> all data formerly stored in $HOME should no be stored here
				=> during transition there is automatic transfer for the user
					=> <oldaccount> data goes to $PROJECT/<oldaccount>
				=> all users have a common view on the project space
			$SCRATCH temporary data, formerly $WORK, in every project as well
