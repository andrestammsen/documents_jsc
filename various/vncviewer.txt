TODO:			MAYBE MERGE IT WITH ANOTHER FILE? OR SHORTEN IT A LITTLE?

idea			provides a service that renders the visualization on jureca
			- a tunnel is opened
			- the pixels are transferred to the local workstation
			- all calculations are executed on the remote server
			- and only the image is shown locally

script name on jureca	vncserver

process name   		Xvnc !!!!????

password		short! (like always, but x3-x2-x1)

login process		short version

			  ssh stammsen2@jureca.fz-juelich.de
			  sbatch --start-xserver vncviewer_four_hours.job
			    vncserver -profile vis -geometry 1920x1080
			  ssh -N -4 -L 5901:jrc1386:5901 stammsen2@jureca.fz-juelich.de
			    ssh -N -4 -L 5901:jurecavis02:5901 stammsen2@jurecavis02.fz-juelich.de
			  ./vncviewer localhost:01
			  !!!!! do not work on a vis node or a login node but a compute node!!!!!

login process		long version

			1) log in to account 

      			  login
      			    ssh stammsen2@jureca.fz-juelich.de
      			      passphrase: SSH-key (like always :)
      			    maybe change password: vncpasswd
			      delete passwd-file in .vnc
			      user normal password, but with 3x2x1-pattern

			2) start VNC server

			  - on an interactive vis login node:
				vncserver -profile vis -geometry 1920x1080
				find out the allocated node (jurecavisxx) and the number of the vnc display (:x)

			  - on a dedicated vis node:
			      write job script (e.g. "vncviewer_four_hours.job")
			      start it by:
				sbatch --start-xserver vncviewer_four_hours.job
			      find out the name of the node on which the job is running and the number of the vnc display
			        by looking at the output generated by slurm which is named after the batch job
			        console output:
				  submitted batch job 12345 => file: slurm.12345.out
				the output file of slurm will be placed in the same folder as the script
			        it takes a few seconds till the file is created

			3) tunnel VNC traffic to workstation (new terminal :)

			  - use for interactive nodes:
			      ssh -N -4 -L 5901:jurecavis02:5901 stammsen2@jurecavis02.fz-juelich.de
			      ( 01 from the display, 02 from the node )
			      ( -4 to make sure that IPv4 is used, otherwise the address might cause problems )
			      ( SSH passphrase required )

			  - use for dedicated nodes:
			      ssh -N -4 -L 5901:jrc1386:5901 stammsen2@jureca.fz-juelich.de
			      (same like above, except jrc1386 instead of jurecavis02 and jureca instead of jurecavis02)

			  ( - display number: port on which I work on jureca	)
			  ( - tunnel only possible with login			)
			  ( - maybe the login node as extra in-between-station	) 
			  ( - port < 1024 for system stuff			)
			  ( - add 5900 to the indicated number			)
			

			4) start VNC viewer and connect (new terminal :)
			    
			    ./vncviewer localhost:01
			    ( ./ is important, because otherwise the bash will search for the vncviewer elsewhere and	)
			    ( activate the standard vncviewer which is not as powerful					)
			    ( use the same number of the display							)
			    ( use the passphrase with x3-x2-x1-format of the passwd in .vnc-folder			)
			    ( in the folder .vnc, a log file and a file containing the process id are created		)

launcher icons		right-click will open a drop down menu which e.g. contains the command behind the launcher icon
