paraview and servers    use a script to start paraview (load modules ...) and a script that start 12 servers (JHG)
                                => WORKS !!!!!
                                => the server script was taken from JHG and starts 12 servers
                                => the communication takes place only between the GUI and the "leading" server

execute python file     ....
as batch job
