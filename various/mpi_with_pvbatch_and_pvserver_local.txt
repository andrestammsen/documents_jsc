README			LOCAL EXECUTION OF MPI WITH PVBATCH AND PVSERVER USING EXAMPLE FILE PARASPHERE.PY

mpi and pv batch	./mpiexec -np 24 ./pvbatch parasphere.py
                                => WORKS !!!!!
                                => local execution
                                => executes script as batch job 
                                => nothing is displayed, but the file "parasphere.png" is created
                                => four processes are used (according to the vtkProcessID coloring)
                                => parallelization is done automatically at the start of the pipeline by pvbatch
                                        => less work since the distribution of the processes requires
                                           no manual actio at the start of the pipeline
                                        => less work since the distribution of the processes requires no manual action
                                        => pvbatch without mpi is the same as pvpython :):)
                                        => pvbatch can only be compiled with MPI, but can be executed without
                                        => dynamic linker will search for libraries to resolve the functions for mpi,
                                           that means that the environment is required
                                               

pvserver with mpi	./mpiexec -np 24 ./pvserver --server-port="11112" (--hostname="localhost" not necessary!!!)
                                => WORKS !!!!! 

                                a) connecting to the server with the GUI 
                                        => WORKS !!!!!
                                        => local execution
                                        => according to the vtkProcessID coloring in parallel
                                        => open GUI, choose server, execute script
                                            
                                b) file as argument to pvpython and pvserver
                                        => WORKS !!!!! (basically, but segmentation fault :( )
                                        => ./pvpython --server-url="cs://localhost:11112" test_server.py
                                        => pass server-url as String to pvpython and pass file as argument
                                        => local execution
                                        => pvpython starts a server, connects to it and executes the script
                                        => TODO: try the same with the sphere to check the parallelism

conn pv GUI to server   ./paraview --server-url="localhost"
at startup                      => DOES NOT WORK !!!!!
                                => local execution
                                => only one vktProcessId is shown as color
