181206	try to release a simple script on a login node with the new usage model
	try to use the automatized scripts to execute the complete task
	DONE: found old account in new usage model

181107	the basic idea for today is to take the next steps in handling the pvserver via
	remote vncserver and paraview GUI; therefore I repeat all succesful steps done so far
	and try to execute them on jureca as well


	- plan 1: start pvserver and run script from inside paraview GUI using vncserver
	  plan 2: start pvserver and run script without paraview GUI using vncserver
	  do this tomorrow after repeating all known steps today


	- use remote VNC

		log in to account on jureca
		start remote VNC server
		tunnel VNC traffic to local workstation
		start local VNC viewer (Turbo) and connect to the remote server
		open paraview via this connection on the remote server


	- execute script locally with pvpython

	  	script		parasphere.py (minimal script from the paraview-tutorial)
		location	local paraview's "bin"-folder
		command		./pvpthon parasphere.py
		parallel	no
		result		SUCCESSFUL
				the image appears swiftly, and a .png-file is created

		other script	manyspheres.py (test script from github benchmark folder)
		location	local paraview's "bin"-folder
		command		./pvpython manyspheres.py
		parallel	no?!
		result		SUCCESSFUL
				the animation is displayed and all the log-files are created


	- execute script locally with pvbatch

	  	script		parasphere.py
	  	location	local paraview's "bin"-folder
		command		./mpiexec -np 4 ./pvbatch parasphere.py
		parallel	yes
		result		SUCCESSFUL
				the image does not appear but is saved as a file (batch mode)
				the amount of nodes used is shown by the coloring of the sphere				
		script		manyspheres.py
		location	local paraview's "bin"-folder
		command		./mpiexec -np 4 ./pvbatch parasphere.py
		parallel	yes
		result		SUCCESSFUL
				it can be executed with and without mpiexec (just a normal batch job)
				I have varied the amount -np between 1, 2 and 4
				I am not sure how to interprete the results
	

	- execute script locally from within local paraview GUI

		script		parasphere.py
		location	local paraview's "bin"-folder
		command		run script (Python shell window in paraview)
		parallel	no
		result		SUCCESSFUL

		script		manyspheres.py
		loc!ation	local paraview's "bin"-folder
		command		run script (Python shell window in paraview)
		parallel	???
		result		NOT SUCCESSFUL
				nothing is shown inside paraview's rendering window
				appearently, the script is not executed at all
				no files are produced in the corresponding folder


	- execute script locally from within local paraview using a manually pre-activated pvserver

		script		parasphere.py
		location	local paraview's "bin"-folder
		command		run script (Python shell window in paraview)
		parallel	yes
		result		SUCCESFUL
				(not actually parallel because of the workstation)
				(the amount of "simulated" nodes is shown as differen colors)


		script		manyspheres.py
		location	local paraview's "bin"-folder
		command		run script (Python shell window in paraview)
		parallel	???
		result		NOT SUCCESSFUL
				same problem like above with executing this script from inside paraview
				=> the answer is probably obvious

	- copy scripts to jureca account using SSH command scp <client> <server>
		1) sphere.py
		2) parasphere.py
		3) manyspheres.py

	- execute simple scripts from inside the ParaView GUI
		- open Python shell (tools)
		- "Run Script"
		- SUCCESSFUL: the results are being displayed in ParaView as usually
